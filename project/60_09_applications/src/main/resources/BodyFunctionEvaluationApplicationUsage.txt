Mental Function Sentences From Interpersonal Interactions and Relationships Entity Annotations

Description
The program MentalFunctionSentenceFromMentionsApplication-jar-with-dependencies.jar reads in GATE files that have been annotated with
interpersonal interactions and relationship entity level mentions.  This program finds the sentences these entity level mentions are in
and creates the following labels.

Output Types/Labels

True are annotations in the output that are sentences that have a mention in them.  These are mostly for the VTT output files

from raw text files with no human annotations, all potental sentences that could have a mention in them will be of the
