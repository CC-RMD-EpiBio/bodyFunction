SegmentBTRISIntoTrainingAndTesting

   This program takes the set of 500 files that have been annotated and are in two serial data stores
   (one for each of the annotators), and segments these back into the training/testing divide that
   originally was set at the beginning of the project.
   
   This program is run after the GATE_Corpus2_UIMAApplication, a program which creates individual 
   GATE xml files out of the serial data stores.   
   
   This program is necessary to maintain the same split for publication sake, to make sure no testing
   data gets used for training when we re-run after updating the data.
